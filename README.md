Here is my HomeWork project, kinda finished, but, not showing all my data ...
... the project has seven sections, and the scoll clips displaing all of them ... 
... in the middle of a section?  I had initially tried to use switch statements ... 
... as you will see as commented-out blocks, never got those to work. 
Also, I had initially wanted to have just one array containing the seven arrays 
 -trying to be very tricky, but could not get excode to cooperate with me ... 
reminds me of Siri ... stupid computers:-?
